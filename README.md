# Database-Simulation
This repository contains source code for a database simulation using c++. The database is partially normalized and uses random values to simulate user input.

# Tables
1) The database primarily contains tables for three shops.
2) A product table containing a list of products and their prices. 
3) A customer table

# Queries
1) How much each customer spends in each shop.
2) How much each custome spends in all three shops.
3) Sales per item in each shop.
4) Sales per item in all three shops.

# Data Visualization
The relationship between customers and products in each shop was expressed using a binary matrix.
The binary matrix was also displayed in a text file in Comma-Separated Values(CSV) format.
